Focusing on the name of the Challenge , i knew it was a OTP ! so basing on that , i used the **cribdrag script** to solve it giving the cipher text in hex format as an input !
We know that utflag would be in the message so we give "utflag{" as a crib as looking for a result !

We found on the index 0 "THE BES" so it must be "THE BEST" !
now the description said that the two friends are arguing about the best category , so i tried with "THE BEST C"
and what we got is good so far :

again continuing with the crib i gave it "THE BEST CATEGORY" but it gave nothing so i tried with "THE BEST CTF CATEGORY" and here we go :
