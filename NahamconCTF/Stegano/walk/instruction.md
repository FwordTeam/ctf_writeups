#instructions 

tried stegolsb wavsteg and go no result even that i tried changing lsb_count 
then i got wav-steg tool https://github.com/pavanchhatpar/wav-steg-py

even tho i think that stegolsb and that python script do the same things but i got lucky to get the flag 

python wav-steg.py -r wazaaa.wav -n 1 -b 50 -o flag.txt

#flag : flag{do_that_bit_again}
