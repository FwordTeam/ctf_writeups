So We found that the password hashed with HAVAL 192,4 ! After decrypting it we find "s3cureP@ssw0rd" <br>
so the password of the zip is : Semah@s3cureP@ssw0rd <br>
we get a QR code but the colors are inverted !  <br>
After inverting the colors and decoding it we find : <br> 
"Lxvnkbgxml{Pa47_p45_ma4m_4ee_4u0nm_???}" <br>
This is a shifted String ! Caesar with key 19 ! <br>
The flag : Securinets{Wh47_w45_th4t_4ll_4b0ut_???}
